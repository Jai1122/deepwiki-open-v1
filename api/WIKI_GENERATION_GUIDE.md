# Enhanced Wiki Generation Guide

## What's Been Fixed

The wiki generation system has been enhanced to address the issues of fragmented pages and missing architectural diagrams.

### Previous Issues:
- ❌ Fragmented pages like "Utilities and Helper", "Testing and Mocks", "Configuration and Constants"
- ❌ Missing mermaid architecture diagrams  
- ❌ No holistic system understanding
- ❌ Disconnected documentation

### New Features:
- ✅ **Holistic Architecture Analysis**: System overview with comprehensive mermaid diagrams
- ✅ **Logical Functional Groupings**: Components grouped by business function, not technical artifact type
- ✅ **Interconnected Pages**: Cross-references and relationships between components
- ✅ **Automatic Mermaid Generation**: Architecture, sequence, and component diagrams

## How to Generate Better Wikis

### 1. Start with Architecture Overview
Ask questions like:
- "Analyze the system architecture and create an overview"
- "Show me the file tree structure and overall system design"
- "Create a comprehensive architecture diagram for this repository"

### 2. Request Functional Groupings
Instead of asking for individual utilities or configs, ask for:
- "Explain the core business logic and workflows"
- "Show me the data management and API layer"
- "Document the user interface and presentation components"

### 3. Ask for Specific Diagrams
- "Create a sequence diagram for the main user workflow"
- "Show the component relationships in a mermaid diagram"
- "Illustrate the data flow through the system"

## New Prompt System

The system now intelligently detects:
- **Architecture queries** → Uses comprehensive overview prompts with mermaid diagrams
- **Component queries** → Uses detailed page prompts with interconnected context

## Expected Improvements

You should now see:
1. **System Architecture Overview** page with comprehensive mermaid diagrams
2. **Functional modules** instead of scattered utility pages
3. **Cross-referenced components** showing relationships
4. **Visual diagrams** for complex interactions
5. **Holistic understanding** rather than fragmented documentation

## Troubleshooting

If you still see fragmented pages:
1. Start with architecture-focused queries first
2. Ask for "comprehensive" or "holistic" analysis
3. Specifically request mermaid diagrams
4. Ask for "functional groupings" rather than technical categories

The enhanced system prioritizes understanding the forest before documenting individual trees.
